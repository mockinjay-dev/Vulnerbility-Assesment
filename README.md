# Penetration Testing using Kali Linux

Perfored a classic vulnerability exploitation of [EternerBlue](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42031) utilizing offensive methods to demonstrate five phases of hacking. We  evaluate  the  security posture  of  its  infrastructure  compared  to  current  industry  bestpractices  that  included  an  external  penetration  test. All  testing performed is based on the ISOEH Technical Guide to InformationSecurity Testing assessment and open source exploiting frameworksand tools.


## Overview of the Architecture
Most basic configuration is used to demonstrate this attack.
- 1 Windows 7 VM (victim)
- 1 Kali VM (attacker)
- Both connected in same lab network.


## Tools Used
- Kali Linux = pentesting distribution
- NMAP = network scanning and system information
- NESSUS = industrial standard network scanner
- METASPLOIT = exploiting the target system
