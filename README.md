# Penetration Testing using Kali Linux

Perform a penetration testing aiming to demonstrate five phases of hacking. We  evaluate  the  security posture  of  its  infrastructure  compared  to  current  industry  bestpractices  that  included  an  external  penetration  test.    All  testingperformed  is  based  on  the  ISOEH  Technical  Guide  to  InformationSecurity Testing assessment and open source exploiting frameworksand tools.

## Assessment Component
An external penetration test emulates the role of an attacker attempting to gain access to aninternal network or system without internal resources or inside knowledge so we use somewell known opensource tools to that. They are following
- Kali Linux = pentesting distribution
- NMAP = network scanning and system information
- NESSUS = industrial standard network scanner
- METASPLOIT = exploiting the target system
